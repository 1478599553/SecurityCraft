IRC means Internet Relay Chat and is basically a server where you can find tons of chatrooms with different topics.
SecurityCraft connects to such a chatroom as soon as you do '/sc connect' and sends all messages from '/sc contact' into that room.
Anyone who is in that room is able to contact you by prefixing your name to their message.
Please note that that person, and noone else either, cannot connect to your world to play with you as this is not possible.
