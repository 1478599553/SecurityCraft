IRC means Internet Relay Chat and is basically a server where you can find tons of chatrooms with different topics.
SecurityCraft connects to such a chatroom as soon as you do '/sc connect' and sends all messages from '/sc contact' into that room.
Anyone who is in that room is able to contact you by prefixing your name to their message.

Please note that the following things are not possible:
- Connecting to your world to play with you
- Controlling your Minecraft client in any ways
- Seeing what you are currently doing
